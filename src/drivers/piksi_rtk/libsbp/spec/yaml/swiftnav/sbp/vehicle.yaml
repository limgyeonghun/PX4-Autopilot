    short_desc: Vehicle forward (x-axis) velocity
    desc: |
      Message representing the x component of vehicle velocity in the user frame at the odometry
      reference point(s) specified by the user. The offset for the odometry reference point and 
      the definition and origin of the user frame are defined through the device settings interface.
      There are 4 possible user-defined sources of this message  which are labeled arbitrarily 
      source 0 through 3.
